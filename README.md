This project is powered by Node.js v16, and utilizes the inquirer v8.2.4 (node package manager), and file system module (node package manager).

Features of this application include the users ability to generate a professional README.md document straight from the command line. The user will answer a series of prompts about their application, and then a README.md markdown file will be generated based on their responses
